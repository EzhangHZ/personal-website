I want to empower everyone who can afford a cellphone to enjoy the benefits of large model on their hands.\nBesides academics and research, I\u0026rsquo;m also interested in gaming, camping and sailing. I used to be a proficient piano player, but my current housing condition doesn\u0026rsquo;t really allow to practice regularly anymore. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m planning to relearn this skill, as well as some music theory and composition once I\u0026rsquo;m settled again.\n","permalink":"https://ezhanghz.onrender.com/posts/introduction/","summary":"Hello there!\nI\u0026rsquo;m a newly graduated CSE graduate in UC San Diego specialized in deep learning and Large Language Models.
